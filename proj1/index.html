		<h1>Overview</h1>
		<p>
			We built the functionality to rasterize triangles and fill them through either using a single color, by interpolating between the colors at the vertices through barycentric coordinates, 
			or by mapping a texture to it. We implemented multiple antialiasing methods such as supersampling, bilinear sampling, mipmaps, and trilinear filtering. We also wrote the functionality 
			basic transforms such as translation, rotation, and scaling. The most interesting thing we've learned is how to use barycentric coordinates to find the correct texture coordinates along
			with using interpolation in trilinear filtering to reduce aliasing.

		<h1>Task 1</h1>
		<p>
			To rasterize a triangle, we first find the bounding box of the triangle through taking the min and max x and y coordinates of the vertices. We then iterate through all the x,y pairs in this
			bounding box and use the three line tests to determine whether each x,y pair belongs in the triangle. In other words, we check each sample within the bounding box of the triangle. To ensure
			that the triangle gets drawn regardless of the winding order of the vertices, we basically check whether or not the line tests produce the same sign. Lastly, if this x,y point is inside the 
			triangle, we rasterize the pixel by calling fill_pixel.

		<h1>Task 2</h1>
		<p>
			To implement supersampling, we modified our rasterize_triangle function such that for every x,y pair, we sample it sample_rate times in a grid pattern. The means we have 4 nested for loops, 
			with the two outer loops iterating over each x,y pair, and the two inner for loops each iterating sqrt(sample_rate) times. To calculate the precise x position, we start by adding an intial
			offset of 1/(2 * sqrt(sample_rate)), and incement by 1 / sqrt(sample_rate) for each i where i is a counter in the inner for loop. We do the same thing with y, but with the other inner for
			loop counter. We then use the same three line tests on our new x,y point to check whether it needs to be sampled. In the case that it needs to be sampled, instead of calling fill_pixel we 
			instead put the Color in the sample_buffer in its respective spot given the x,y coordinate. Using the sample_buffer means we have to modify the rasterization pipeline, such as in the functions
			set_sample_rate and set_framebuffer_target to resize our sample_buffer to a size of width * height * sample_rate. We also needed to modify resolve_to_framebuffer to average the sample_rate
			Colors for each pixel in the original size and use that color in the frame buffer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Supersampling is useful because it is a way of antialiasing which is acheived by increasing the sampling rate. For example, in the triangles below, we reduce jaggies through supersampling. As 
			we increase sampling rate, the edges and corners of the triangle become smoother and continuous because by sampling at more points the edges will have a more gradual change rather than a sharp
			change and we are less likely to skip over parts of a skinny triangle corner which would otherwise cause floating pixels.

		<h1>Task 3</h1>
		<p>Lorem ipsum</p>
		<h1>Task 4</h1>
		<p>The barycentric coordinate is essentially a way of finding where a point inside a triangle is relative to its vertices. We do this by finding the weights of each vertex for each point and this 
			would allow us to interpolate within the triangle through a weighted sum of the vertices. For example, in the image below, each vertex of the triangle has a pure color of red, green, or blue. In 
			the area in between the vertices, the value of a pixel is a mix of red, green, and blue, with the strength of each component relative to the points distance from its respective vertex.

		<h1>Task 5</h1>
		<p>
			Given that we want to apply a texture to a pixel x,y in screen space, we will need to convert it to a point u,v in texture space for pixel sampling. We can find the u,v coordinates through the barycentric coordinates
			given that we know the u,v positions of the vertices of the triangle. After acquiring the u,v coordinate, we can sample it with nearest pixel or bilinear filtering. In nearest pixel, We return the 
			color of the nearest pixel to our u,v position. In bilinear filtering, we interpolate between the 4 nearest pixels (by doing linear interpolation 3 times) and then return the color.

			We can tell that in bilinear filtering the image is smoother and less sharp compared to nearest pixel, as the color of each pixel in the image is averaged between 4 pixels in texture space rather than 
			just one. The difference between nearest pixel and bilinear filtering is more clear when the frequency of the image far outstrips the sampling rate. For example, when the sampling rate is 16, it is harder
			to tell the difference between nearest and bilinear since the sampling rate is already high relative to the image frequency. However, on sampling rate 1, one can noticeably discern that bilinear filtering
			smoothens the image compared ot nearest pixel.

		<h1>Task 6</h1>
		<p>
			Level sampling is choosing the optimal mipmap level to use for sampling. When the original texture is larger than the screen space that it is mapping to, we need to lower its resolution appropriately (filtering 
			the high frequencies) by convoluting and averaging its pixels. Instead of doing this on the fly, we store precomputed mipmaps to make the process more efficient. Thus level sampling methods are ways of finding 
			the right mipmap level to use. The formula to finding the right level works by looking at how much a position in texture space changes relative to a change in screen space and scaling it logarithmically. After 
			getting this level value, there are two different approaches: we can use the mipmap level closest to this value, or we can interpolate between the two nearest mipmap levels and use that (bilinear). 
		</p>
		<p>
			For a comparison of pixel sampling, level sampling, and super sampling, in terms of memory usage super sampling will need a sampling buffer of sampling_rate times larger if done the naive way. Level sampling, which 
			uses mipmaps, will require the mipmaps to be computed and stored. Pixel sampling should not use a significant amount of additional memory. In terms of speed, super sampling will require at least sample_rate times 
			more of computation, as it would need to sample sample_rate more times and then also convolute it from the sample buffer to the frame buffer, which should make super sampling the least efficient. Pixel sampling and 
			level sampling should have similar levels of computation, as they both use nearest pixel/level and bilinear filtering. Since level sampling uses precomputed mipmaps, it is still fairly fast. In the nearest setting, we 
			only need to do a fast computation for both. Bilinear filtering for pixel sampling involves sampling from 4 texels and then performing 3 linear interpolations. Bilinear filtering for level sampling involves sampling 
			from the two nearest mipmap levels and then interpolating them. For overall aliasing power, supersampling is the best, but requires the most computation. Level sampling comes second, but requires mipmaps to be precomputed 
			and stored. Pixel sampling comes last, but does not require additional memory and is relatively fast.
